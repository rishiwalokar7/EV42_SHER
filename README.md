# EV42_SHER – Smart Health Early Risk Prediction

**SHER (Smart Health Early Risk Prediction)** is an AI-powered healthcare analytics project designed to predict early risk of chronic diseases using clinically validated, population-scale health data.

---

## Problem Statement
Chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disorders develop silently. Traditional systems fail to capture complex patterns, leading to delayed diagnosis. SHER leverages machine learning for early risk prediction and preventive insights.

---

## Objectives
- Early disease risk prediction
- Explainable AI-based risk factor identification
- Preventive and personalized insights
- Ethical, fair, and privacy-preserving data usage

---

## Project Roadmap
Data Collection → Preprocessing → ML Modeling → Explainability → Preventive Insights

---

## Data Sources
- NHANES (Clinical Labs & Vitals)
- PhysioNet (MIMIC-IV / eICU)
- CDC Open Data Portal
- WHO Global Health Observatory API
- Columbia University Disease Symptom Knowledge

---

## Diseases Covered
Currently supports 5 diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular conditions, with scope for expansion.

---

## Data Ethics
- Anonymized datasets
- Public and government-led sources
- Privacy and fairness compliant

---
## Current Diseases
Pneumonia
Diabetes
Heart Attack
Malaria
